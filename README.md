# Arduino_Irrigation_System
Smart Irrigation System using an Arudino Uno (Written in C++)

The purpose of this project was to measure the moisture of plants and feed them water when meeting a certain threshold. The pump/sensor system is one to one so this project has 3 sensors and 3 pumps, one per plant.


Parts:
1. Capacitive Moisture Sensor x3, 
2. 4-Way Relay Module
3. Water Pump x3
4. Arduino Uno
5. Food Grade Tube
6. 120v to 12v Power Supply
